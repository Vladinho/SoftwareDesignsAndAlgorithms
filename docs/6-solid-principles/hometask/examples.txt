1. S  https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/animations/src/animation_builder.ts#L57
    AnimationBuilder has only one responsibility.
2. O https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/integrationtest/src/jit_summaries.ts#L27
    Base is opened to be extended and closed to be changed.
3. L https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-server/src/domino_adapter.ts#L41
    Method setRootDomAdapter takes adapter (type - DomAdapter). So BrowserDomAdapter can be easily replaced with DominoAdapter as we can see: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/browser/browser_adapter.ts#L22
4. I  https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/dom_renderer.ts#L99
    EmulatedEncapsulationDomRenderer2 or DefaultDomRenderer2 can be return from  createRenderer().

Anti Solid
1. S https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/router.ts#L371
    Router is too clever. I would suggest to split it into NavigationExecuter and NavigationGuards classes and move logic of setupNavigations there.
2. O https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-browser/src/dom/dom_renderer.ts#L95
    The better way is to remove switch/case and extend DomRendererFactory2.
3. L https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/platform-server/src/domino_adapter.ts#L79
    getBaseHref returns string, but in the parent class in returns string | null
4. I https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/router/src/router.ts#L251
    NavigationTransition is too big and complex
5. D https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/packages/compiler-cli/src/ngtsc/metadata/src/util.ts#L202
    MetadataReader should be a base class and have only abstract method getData.
